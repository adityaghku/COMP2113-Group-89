The game we are trying to create is an electronic version of blackjack. In this game, the player can play the game blackjack against the dealer, choosing their own bet amount to try and win as much money as possible against the casino. 

### Game Rules
1. In Blackjack, the player has to try to beat the dealer without going bust.
2. Numbered cards are worth their actual value, face cards are all worth 10, and Aces are worth either 1 or 11, whichever leads to a better hand.
3. The player begins with 2 faceup cards while the dealer receives one facedown and one faceup card.
4. If the sum of the values of the players cards exceeds 21, they go "bust" and automatically lose the round.
5. The player can either "hit" or "stand" on each turn. If they "hit" then they receive another card. If they stand, they do not want more cards and the round is over.
6. If you receive an Ace and a face card as your first two cards, then you have received Blackjack and you automatically receive your bet plus 1.5 times your bet back.
7. If you win a round normally, you receive your original bet plus an amount equal to your original bet back.
8. After you stand, it is now the dealers turn. The dealer will hit until their score is 17 or higher, after which they will stand. The winner of the round is the individual with the score closest to 21, but not more than 21.
